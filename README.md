# MongoApp

RCB Week 18 Homework Assignment

This app scrapes article data from arstechnica.com and puts them indo a MongoDB database. The articles are then pulled from the DB and displayed on the page. When you click on an article, you can write a note with a title and save it for that article. This is saved to the database and is loaded the next time you click on that article. It can then be edited and the update will be save to the DB.
